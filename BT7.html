        A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the sides of the mouth . It is
        believed
        it takes about 80 muscles to smile . Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the corner of the eyes
        , an action known as a " Duchenne smile " . Smiles performed without the eye contraction may be perceived as
        insincere
